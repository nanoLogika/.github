<!--## Hi there 👋-->

nanoLogika is a company located in Berlin, Germany. We are focused on electronic product catalogues and
product configuration systems. [produktLogika&#174;](https://www.nanologika.de/produktkonfigurator/)
is nanoLogika's catalog-based product configuration system. Visit https://www.nanologika.de to
get more information about us.

## New: nanoLogika Open Source Projects
To support projects with a produktLogika product configurator that combines parts of 2D drawings
created in AutoCAD nanoLogika developed a DWG-to-SVG converter [ACad/SVG](https://github.com/nanoLogika/ACadSvg).
The [ACad SVG Studio](https://github.com/nanoLogika/ACadSvgStudio) can be used to view and edit the
converted SVG text and display it in an integrated browser.
